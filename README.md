## Collection Day Lambda

This project provides users with a reminder the day before their collection day as well as providing information on
which type of collection will occur e.g. regular trash, compost, or recycling etc. This project uses AWS Lambda to
make a request to the [King County Collection Day Tool][].
 
The Lambda function is configured to run on a specific day at a specific time that the user configures for the
notification to be sent. This is to reduce the number of calls to the King County website as well as a cost saving
mechanism.
